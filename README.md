## Final year main project

This project aims to implement a prototype of a system that allows group missions (such as military missions) to be carried out efficiently. It provides a communication system that would provide all obtainable information from the user surroundings (such as lighting, temperature, proximity to other members, relative coordinates of each participant etc.) to a control room. It also facilitates seamless communication between the participants and the control room. 

To implement this, IoT technology is vastly used - there are multiple sensors that record data and activity from the user and broadcast it to a central server which then processes the data and generates useful information that can be used to essentially help the user make valid and informed decisions pertaining to the operation they're involved in. It also facilitates communication with other members quite easier and effortless.
